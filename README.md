## **About**

**KILL THE FOOD PYRAMID** is a fast-paced, wave-based 2D shooter built with **Godot 4.4.1+**.
Each floor of the Food Pyramid challenges you with new enemies and ends in a showdown against a food boss.

The current version is in **very early alpha**, featuring:

* **5 levels total** — 4 wave-based and 1 boss level
* A single playable weapon (**the pistol**)
* Early enemy and level designs
* Basic systems for progression and combat

The long-term goal is to turn this into a wild, upgrade-filled arcade shooter full of goofy weapons, chaotic enemies, and over-the-top food fights.

## **Features (Current Alpha)**

* **5 Levels Total** – 4 wave-based + 1 boss level
* **Wave-based combat** – survive against endless swarms of food
* **Single weapon: the pistol** – the starting tool of food destruction
* **Boss fight** – face off against the ruler of the first floor
* **Original + CC0 pixel art** style
* **Fast, crunchy combat** loop

## **How to Play**

1. **Survive each wave** of food-themed enemies attacking from all sides.
2. **Shoot** with your pistol to clear enemies before they swarm you.
3. **Progress through 4 waves**, then **defeat the boss** to finish the first floor.
4. That’s all for now — but the pyramid goes much higher…
