# **KILL THE FOOD PYRAMID v0.0.0**

*A 2D pixel wave-based shooter made in Godot.*

You are an orange, slightly odd robot with one purpose: **destroy the Food Pyramid.**
Blast through relentless waves of furious food, survive each floor, and face the mighty Kings of Food in chaotic boss battles. Along the way, you’ll help **Cyber Cat** find fragments of the mysterious **Green Shard**—one of which is hidden in the final level.

## **About**

**KILL THE FOOD PYRAMID** is a fast-paced, wave-based 2D shooter built with **Godot 4.4.1+**.
Each floor of the Food Pyramid challenges you with new enemies and ends in a showdown against a food boss.

The current version **v0.0.0** is in **very early alpha**, featuring:

* **5 levels total** — 4 wave-based levels + 1 boss level
* A single playable weapon (**the pistol**)
* Early enemy and level designs
* Basic progression and combat systems

The first five levels include swarms of **breads, black breads, huge breads, pasta, spaghetti, baguettes, potatoes, and sweet potatoes**, culminating in a final showdown against **King Bread**.

The long-term goal is to turn this into a wild, upgrade-filled arcade shooter full of goofy weapons, chaotic enemies, and over-the-top food fights.
