About:
- KILL THE FOOD PYRAMID is a chaotic wave-based shooter where every floor of the Food Pyramid challenges you with new enemies and bosses. Survive the swarms, stack upgrades, and climb higher until you face the Kings of Foods themselves.

- The game is built in Godot 4.4.1+, using a mix of self-made and CC0 pixel assets. Right now it’s a prototype, but the vision is:
  1) Fast, crunchy combat
  2) Lots of silly weapons and upgrades
  3) Replayability with endless waves and co-op support

Features:
- Wave-based enemy spawning — each wave gets tougher and wilder
- Multiple weapon types — from classic guns to goofy food-themed firepower
- Kings of Foods (Boss fights) — each pyramid level ends with a ruler of a food group
- Upgrade system — stack modifiers and items to shape your build
- Save & checkpoint system — carry progress between runs
- Pixel art style — CC0 + original assets
- Planned Infinite Wave Mode — survive forever if you dare

How to play:
- Survive waves of food enemies that spawn from every side.
- Shoot or melee:
  1) Guns are safe but consume ammo/cooldowns.
  2) Melee attacks do big damage — but consume charges and you risk getting close.
- Earn currency/loot by defeating enemies.
- Visit the store between floors to buy items, upgrades, and new weapons.
- Climb the Food Pyramid floor by floor, until you face the Kings.

Controls:
- W/A/S/D or ARROW KEYS: move
- SHIFT: dash
- Mouse: aim & shoot
- E: melee
- X: interact

Requirements: 
- Godot 4.4.1 or newer (to build from source)
- Should run on almost anything that isn’t actually a potato

Roadmap 
- More weapons (lasers, goofy food guns, melee weapons)
- Additional levels 
- Expanded upgrade system with synergies
- UI/UX polish + better menus
- Infinite wave survival mode
- Local co-op mode (grab a friend and wreck food together)
- Steam release planning

KILL THE FOOD PYRAMID is still in early development. Follow the repo, open issues, or share upgrade/weapon ideas — the sillier, the better.
